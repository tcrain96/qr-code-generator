# QR Code Generator

An easy to use QR Code Generator that takes a link and turns it into a downloadable QR Code in SVG format.

## Description

QR Codes can be very useful in a variety of communication settings! I use them endlessly at work. That's why I decided to simplify things and instead of paying for a generation program, why not build one myself. This generator is simple, quick, and works for any QR Code needs.
